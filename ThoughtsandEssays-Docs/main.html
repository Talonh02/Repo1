    <h1>Main</h1>
    
    <p>For as far back as I can remember, I loved to ask the question "why?". Of a teacher, why the line never reaches the asymptote, of my parents why I have to go to bed even though I'm not tired, or of a Priest why it was necessary for God to send his son on his Earthly errand. It seemed almost unfailingly, that behind any answer seemingly self evident to other people, there was much more content buried behind such a simple question. I was delighted to find out in my first year of university that this compulsion had a name, Philosophy. A Philosophy degree however, is not known as a guarantor of financial security, thus I studied finance.</p>

    <p>Finance, I think to many, represents the peak of academic superficiality. A degree that only money hungry capitalist pigs enter into in order to parasitically siphon money from the system of hard working citizens by means of gambling and usury. When one pauses to further contemplate however, the role of finance in the world, the science, and the philosophy behind it, they would soon realize how important, and interesting of a discipline it really is. Like philosophy, finance is something I consider to be a pervasive subject as its influences touches almost everything one encounters on a daily basis. <a href="financial-history.html" class="financial-link">It is after all, in its essence, the theory of value and how to allocate it. For better or worse, value in our modern society is measured by how much something is worth on the open market i.e how much people are willing to pay for it. This obviously creates all sorts of probelms for things some people see as a right or as beyond the scope of monetary value or things with sentimenal worth etc but the mechanics of this are particularly ineresting when it comes to evaluating the value of a business. Since businesses don't typically have much senitmental value to small investors, and economics assumes informed and rational agents, the value of a business is determined as the present value of future remittances to the investors, adjusted for risk. </a></p>
