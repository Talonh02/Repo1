Each project showcases proficiency in data acquisition, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling using R programming.

## Projects

### 🏀 Fantasy Basketball Analytics
**Objective:** Develop a predictive model for NBA player performance to optimize fantasy basketball portfolio decisions

**Methodology:**
- Historical data acquisition via web scraping (Basketball Reference, 2000-2025)
- Random Forest machine learning implementation
- Statistical analysis of player performance patterns and team dynamics
- Performance validation using out-of-sample testing

**Key Results:** Achieved 73% variance explanation (R² = 0.73) in predicting player fantasy scores
