	•	Academic Term Taken: Winter 2025
	•	Course Status: Completed (Grade: A)
	•	Core Learning Objectives and Content: "Selected Topics in Finance" courses like FIN 488 allow for focused study on specific, often contemporary, areas within finance. The subtitle "Entrepreneurial Finance" 1 clearly indicates that this iteration of the course concentrated on the financial aspects of starting, funding, and growing new ventures. General topics in entrepreneurial finance typically include the valuation of entrepreneurial ventures and startups (which often lack historical data), various financing strategies and sources (e.g., bootstrapping, angel investing, venture capital, crowdfunding, debt financing for small businesses), understanding and constructing capitalization tables ("cap tables"), analyzing capital constraints faced by new firms, and examining exit strategies for entrepreneurs and investors (e.g., IPOs, acquisitions) and the returns they generate.93 The course explores how entrepreneurial firms differ significantly from established public corporations in their financing needs, risks, and opportunities.94
	•	Key Skills and Competencies Developed: Students learn techniques for valuing startups and high-growth ventures, gain an understanding of the venture financing process and landscape, develop skills in analyzing entrepreneurial investment opportunities, and acquire knowledge of the unique financial challenges and strategic considerations pertinent to new ventures. An 'A' in Entrepreneurial Finance, a specialized and often case-based course, shows strong applied financial skills and an understanding of a dynamic and important sector of the economy. This could indicate an interest in innovation, high-growth ventures, and alternative investment classes.
	•	Potential Applications and Value of Learning: This knowledge is highly relevant for students interested in careers in entrepreneurship (as founders or early employees), venture capital, private equity, investment banking focused on emerging companies, or consulting for startups.
	•	FIN 488: SELECTED TOPICS IN FINANCE (Subtitle: FinTech: Concepts, Tools, and Applications)
	•	Faculty/Department Offering Course: Finance
	•	Academic Term Taken: Winter 2025
	•	Course Status: Completed (Grade: A-)
	•	Core Learning Objectives and Content: The subtitle "FinTech: Concepts, Tools, and Applications" 1for this second FIN 488 course suggests an advanced exploration of the intersection of finance and technology. Building on foundational FinTech knowledge (potentially from courses like FIN 449 FinTech I 95 which covers programming and FinTech drivers, and FIN 450 FinTech II 89 which focuses on applied data science), this course would likely delve into the practical application of technologies to transform financial services.

The course might involve analyzing current FinTech innovations, disruptive business models, case studies of successful and unsuccessful FinTech companies, and the broader strategic implications of technological disruptions for the traditional financial industry.96
	•	Key Skills and Competencies Developed: Students gain a deeper understanding of current FinTech trends, enabling technologies, and innovative business models. They develop the ability to analyze the impact of technology on various segments of the financial services industry, apply data science tools to FinTech-related problems, and think strategically about financial innovation and disruption. Taking two distinct FIN 488 "Selected Topics" courses in the same term, one in Entrepreneurial Finance (Grade A) and another in FinTech (Grade A-), especially following FIN 450 (FinTech II: Applied Data Science) in the previous term, demonstrates a very strong and focused interest in the modern, technology-driven, and innovative aspects of finance. This specialization is highly current and positions Mr. Hird well for emerging roles in the financial industry that require expertise in how technology and entrepreneurial models are reshaping finance.
	•	Potential Applications and Value of Learning: This course prepares students for roles directly within the FinTech industry, in innovation or digital transformation departments of traditional financial institutions, in technology consulting focusing on financial services, or in regulatory bodies grappling with new financial technologies.
	•	PHIL 325: RISK, CHOICE AND RATIONALITY
	•	Faculty/Department Offering Course: Philosophy
	•	Academic Term Taken: Winter 2025
	•	Course Status: Completed (Grade: A-)
	•	Core Learning Objectives and Content: PHIL 325 serves as an introduction to formal decision theory from a philosophical perspective. It surveys the prospects and limitations of applying mathematically precise models to understand and guide good decision-making, often referred to as rational decision theory. The course typically covers foundational concepts such as modeling individual preferences and utilities, understanding and interpreting probabilities (including different philosophical interpretations of probability), and analyzing decision-making under conditions of risk (where probabilities are known) and uncertainty (where probabilities are unknown). It often examines normative theories of choice, such as expected utility theory (e.g., von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory), and may explore elements of game theory to understand strategic interactions between rational agents. The course might also touch upon paradoxes of choice, critiques of standard rationality models, and extensions to collective decision-making or social choice theory, including voting methods.98
	•	Key Skills and Competencies Developed: Students develop an understanding of formal decision theory models, skills in analyzing the structure of choice situations under conditions of uncertainty and risk, the ability to apply probability and utility theory to decision problems, and a capacity for critical evaluation of different models of rationality and their assumptions. PHIL 325 is an excellent capstone-like course for a student combining a Finance major and a Philosophy minor. The study of risk, choice, and rationality from a formal philosophical perspective directly complements financial theories of decision-making under uncertainty, portfolio theory, asset pricing, and behavioral finance. An A- here shows a high-level ability to integrate quantitative and qualitative reasoning in complex decision contexts, allowing for a critical examination of the assumptions underlying many financial models from a different intellectual tradition. This suggests an ability to think deeply and critically about the very foundations of decision-making, a skill that transcends mere technical proficiency in finance and can lead to more robust and ethically sound financial reasoning.
	•	Potential Applications and Value of Learning: This course provides a formal and philosophical grounding for understanding decision-making under uncertainty, which is highly relevant to finance (e.g., investment decisions, risk assessment, financial modeling), business strategy, economics, public policy, and any field requiring rigorous analysis of choices and outcomes.
	•	SEM 333: TECH VENTURE: ENTRE INV GROWTH
	•	Faculty/Department Offering Course: Strategic Management and Organization (SEM)
	•	Academic Term Taken: Winter 2025
	•	Course Status: Completed (Grade: A)
	•	Core Learning Objectives and Content: SEM 333, often titled "Technology Ventures: Navigating Entrepreneurial Innovation and Growth," explores the dynamic world of high-growth, technology-based entrepreneurial ventures. The course is frequently offered in partnership with university innovation funds or centers and aims to provide students with insights into how such ventures are created, funded, and scaled. Students typically learn about the changing landscape of innovation ecosystems, discover how entrepreneurs identify and develop entrepreneurial possibilities, build effective teams, and understand the foundational elements of how new ventures acquire critical resources (especially funding) to support their growth trajectories. The course is often enriched with guest speakers from the local innovation community, successful entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and experts from key technology-driven industries such as artificial intelligence, health tech, energy tech, and agricultural tech.100
	•	Key Skills and Competencies Developed: Students gain an understanding of the processes involved in technology venture creation and growth, the characteristics of innovation ecosystems, principles of entrepreneurial team building, and strategies for resource acquisition (including early-stage financing) for high-growth businesses.
	•	Potential Applications and Value of Learning: This course is ideal for students interested in careers in technology startups (as founders or key employees), venture capital, corporate venturing (innovation within larger companies), or roles supporting the entrepreneurship ecosystem. It complements the "Entrepreneurial Finance" topic taken in FIN 488 by providing a broader strategic and organizational perspective on tech ventures.
2.13 Spring Term 2025 (Faculty of Business, Bachelor of Commerce - Finance, Philosophy Minor)
	•	HIST 115: TECHNOLOGY AND HISTORY
	•	Faculty/Department Offering Course: History
	•	Academic Term Taken: Spring 2025
	•	Course Status: No Grade (Appears In Progress or Recently Completed at time of transcript issuance)
	•	Core Learning Objectives and Content: HIST 115 examines the complex and reciprocal relationship between technology and social change throughout human history. The course typically surveys a wide span of time, from prehistoric stone tools to 21st-century advancements like nanotechnology, focusing on how technological developments have both shaped human societies and, in turn, been shaped by societal needs, values, and structures. Key topics often include an overview of important technological innovations across different eras (e.g., the Agricultural Revolution, the printing press, the Industrial Revolution, the development of electricity, the rise of the computer age, and contemporary biotechnologies and nanotechnologies) and an analysis of their profound social, economic, cultural, and political impacts.102
	•	Key Skills and Competencies Typically Developed: Students are expected to develop an understanding of the historical interplay between technology and society, skills in analyzing the impact of specific technologies on social change, critical thinking about the broader societal implications of technological advancements, and foundational historical analysis skills. The choice of HIST 115 as a late-stage elective, even without a grade yet recorded, continues the theme of broad intellectual exploration evident in Mr. Hird's record (e.g., ENT 101). Understanding the historical impact of technology can provide valuable context for a Finance student specializing in FinTech, offering perspectives on adoption cycles, societal resistance or acceptance of new technologies, and the often unforeseen long-term consequences of technological innovation. This historical perspective can enrich strategic thinking about technological disruption, particularly within the financial sector.
	•	Potential Applications and Value of Learning: This course provides essential historical context for understanding contemporary technological advancements and their wide-ranging societal ramifications. It fosters critical thinking about the future trajectory of technology and its relationship with human society.
